        <h2>You slay many orcs but suddenly they scatter as a deep rumbling echos from deep within the mine. 
          <strong>The Balrog</strong> emergizes, and chases you to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. The exit is
          within sight but in order for you and your companions to escape, the wizard sacrifices themselves
          to slay <strong>The Balrog</strong>.
